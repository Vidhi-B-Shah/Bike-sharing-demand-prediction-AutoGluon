# Bike Share Demand Prediction using AutoGluon

## Description

This project leverages AutoGluon, an open-source AutoML toolkit, to predict bike share demand. Using historical data on bike rentals, the model aims to forecast future demand to assist in optimizing bike availability and distribution.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone the repo
    cd bike-share-demand-prediction
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install AutoGluon:
    ```sh
    pip install autogluon
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the Jupyter notebook:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```
